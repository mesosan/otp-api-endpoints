# OTP Spammer
This project was made for absolutely no reason other than I was bored.
But still, it does create a purpose for itself on it's own.
    - Companies should make their endpoints have some kind of authorization
        - probably some bearer tokens and cookies

***NOTE*** - This was made just as a POC.
